BogApp is an open source literature web/app. The initial focus is the danish libraries as a starting point. The intention is to make it international, and extend to wider literary communities than just the libraries.

You are [welcome to join](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Tasks / subprojects currently in progress

- Setup project infrastructure
- Merge core functionality of <a href="https://github.com/solsort/mobibl">MoBibl</a> and <a href="https://github.com/solsort/rdf">solsort/RDF</a> into the project
- Document decisions / approach / tasks


# Roadmap

## v0.1.0 

Core functionality:

- rewrite basic functionality from <a href="https://github.com/solsort/mobibl">MoBibl</a> 
- rewrite basic functionality from <a href="https://github.com/solsort/rdf">solsort/RDF</a>
- sections
    - *bogapp* general information about books (and the app)
    - *bibdata*  bibliographic data 
    - *biblioteksapp* information about / from the libraries
- serverside rendering / search engine optimised, to encourage discovery of literature through organic search

Non-functional requirements:

- new design(Material), probably partly based on DDB-App when it becomes open source
- unit testing/coverage
- made with mainstream technologies: JavaScript/React to make it easy for other developers to get into the code
- as contributor friendly as possible (contributing guide, get-started-issues, etc.), and start building community around the app development
