BogApp is an open source literature web/app *under development*. The initial focus is the danish libraries as a starting point. The intention is to make it international, and extend to wider literary communities than just the libraries.

# Roadmap

## v0.1.0 

Core functionality:

- rewrite basic functionality from <a href="https://github.com/solsort/mobibl">MoBibl</a> 
    - search
    - view manifest/work
    - order book from library
    - patron status including renew etc.
- rewrite basic functionality from <a href="https://github.com/solsort/rdf">solsort/RDF</a>
- scan a book - scan isbn barcode to look up a book
- serverside rendering / search engine optimised, to encourage discovery of literature through organic search

Non-functional requirements:

- new design(Material), probably partly based on DDB-App when it becomes open source
- unit testing/coverage
- made with mainstream technologies: JavaScript/React to make it easy for other developers to get into the code
- as contributor friendly as possible (contributing guide, get-started-issues, etc.), and start building community around the app development
