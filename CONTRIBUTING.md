# Welcome

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to join! :tada::+1:

Feel free to join our [public discussion channel](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#mobibl:matrix.org) on <https://riot.im> and say hi.
We try to meet there on Sundays at 19:30 (CEST summer/CET winter).

To help out, you
can just start working on whatever you are interested in :)
or you can take on any task, that is not marked `in progress` or `ready`

We [plan and manage the project](https://github.com/solsort/bogapp/issues) using github issues, please add ideas/issues, comment on existing issues etc.  To get an overview of the ongoing work see <https://waffle.io/solsort/bogapp>.

## Guidelines

<p><details>
  <summary><b>Working language:</b> English</summary>
The vision is that the project should be usable internationally.
The first version of the app is made in english, and then i18n to danish.
</details></p>

<p><details>
  <summary><b>Design:</b> <a href="https://material.io/guidelines">Material</a> 
  </summary>
  Material gives a common foundation and language for reasoning about the design.
  Following Material Design guidelines, also makes easier to collaborate on components etc. with other projects.
  It also feels more native on android, - and is a design language that is being used all across platforms, so users are getting used to it.
</details></p>

<details>
  <summary><b>Design framework:</b> <i>undetermined</i>
  </summary>
  Currently using react-md, - tried material-ui earlier, which didn't play well.
</details>

<p><details>
  <summary><b>Build framework:</b> next.js</summary>
  Simple way to get server-side rendering, and has a large community momentum.
</details></p>

<p><details>
  <summary><b>Issue tracking:</b><a href="https://github.com/solsort/bogapp">github issues</a></summary>

- [starter](https://github.com/solsort/bogapp/labels/starter) issues that are easy to get started on

</details></p>

<p><details>
  <summary><b>Philosophy:</b> Keep it simple</summary>
